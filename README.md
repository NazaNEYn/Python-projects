# Python Projects
This is a collection of all the projects I've made while learning Python. You can find different types of projects here, like games, creative apps, and helpful scripts.<br>
Each project has its own folder, and each one has its own file with more details and demos.

## üöÄ How to Run a Project
Each project is in its own folder, so they are easy to run on their own.<br>

1. **Get the code:** First, you need to copy this whole project to your computer. Use the command line and type this:<br>
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
2. **Go to a project:** Move into the folder of the project you want to run.<br>
   ```python
   # Example: To go to the Monster Brawl Game folder
   cd monster-brawl-game
   ```
3. Run the program: Then, you can run the main file of the project.<br>
   ```python
   python monster_brawl.py
   ```

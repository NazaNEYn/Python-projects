# Python Projects
This is a collection of my Python projects. I made them to show my skills in making games, creating useful tools, and other kinds of programming. Each project is in its own folder, and each one has its own file with more details.

## üöÄ How to Run a Project
Each project is in its own folder, so they are easy to run on their own.<br>

1. **Get the code:** First, you need to copy this whole project to your computer. Use the command line and type this:<br>
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
2. **Go to a project:** Move into the folder of the project you want to run.<br>
   ```python
   # Example: To go to the Monster Brawl Game folder
   cd monster-brawl-game
   ```
3. Run the program: Then, you can run the main file of the project.<br>
   ```python
   python monster_brawl.py
   ```

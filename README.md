## How to Run a Project
Each project is in its own folder, so they are easy to run on their own.<br>

1. **Get the code:** First, you need to copy this whole project to your computer. Use the command line and type this:<br>
   ```python
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
2. **Go to a project:** Move into the folder of the project you want to run.<br>
   ```python
   # Example: To go to the Monster Brawl Game folder
   cd monster-brawl-game
